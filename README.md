# Abidjan Urban Microstratification Project Codebase 

## Overview
Welcome to the README for the Abidjan urban malaria microstratification project. This repository hosts a collection of R and Python scripts to analyse a wide range of datasets to understand malaria risk and inform a deprioritization approach for a public health intervention. Our analyses leverage data on real estate dynamics, settlement types, NASA-derived environmental indices like the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and rainfall, as well as raster-based spatial analyses. Additionally, we perform exploratory analyses focusing on the relationships between settlements, administrative boundaries, and road infrastructure. 



## Getting Started

Ensure you have R, Python and RStudio or JupyterLab installed on your machine. This codebase requires several R packages and Python libraries. The specific datasets used are detailed within each script's documentation.


## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the codebase are welcomed. Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request with a detailed description of your contributions.

## License

This project is released under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file in the repository for more details.

## Acknowledgments

Our gratitude goes out to NASA and other organizations for making environmental data accessible for research purposes.
