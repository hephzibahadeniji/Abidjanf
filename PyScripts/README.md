# Python Codebase for Abidjan Settlement Project

## Overview

Welcome to the `README.md` for the Python codebase of the Abidjan Settlement Analysis and Classification using Machine Learning. This sub-repository hosts a collection of Python scripts aimed at analyzing settlement types, real estate dynamics, environmental factors, and spatial characteristics within Abidjan. Our analyses leverage data on real estate, NASA-derived environmental indices like the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and rainfall, as well as raster-based spatial analyses. Additionally, we perform exploratory analyses focusing on the relationships between settlements, administrative boundaries, and road infrastructure.
