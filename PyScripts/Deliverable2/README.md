        Python Code for Coordinate Training Data Extraction
    </center>
</h2>


## Overview

This deliverable will include a well-documented Python script that extracts coordinate training data (to be exported to the GEE platform) including synthetic data obtained based on sampling simulations.

For simulated training points, the script is capable of taking user-defined parameters like the study area and the desired number of samples for each EA centroid with its settlement type.

The overall output is a CSV file of feature collections containing the extracted and simulated training points with labels for different associated settlement types.
